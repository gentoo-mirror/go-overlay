		Gollum is a n:m multiplexer that gathers messages from different sources
		and broadcasts them to a set of destinations.

		Gollum originally started as a tool to MUL-tiplex LOG-files (read it
		backwards to get the name). It quickly evolved to a one-way router for
		all kinds of messages, not limited to just logs. Gollum is written in Go
		to make it scaleable and easy to extend without the need to use a
		scripting language.
